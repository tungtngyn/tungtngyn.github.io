## Introduction

Hi, my name is Tung (pronounced "tongue", like your tongue!). I'm a self-motivated and results-driven engineer with over 8 years of professional experience, specializing in data engineering and analytics.

My background is in computational mechanics, where I focused on numerical optimization and finite element modeling to solve high-dimensional engineering problems. That foundation naturally evolved into an interest in data, AI, and backend technologies. In my current role, I focus on converting fragmented ERP / operational datasets into reliable and scalable data products that drive critical business decisions.

In my free-time, I enjoy traveling, trying new foods, long-distance running, and hanging out with my cat, Penny.
