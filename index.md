## Introduction

Hi, my name is Tung (pronounced "tongue", like your tongue!). I'm a self-motivated and results-driven engineer specializing in data engineering and analytics. 

I have an engineering background, focusing on numerical optimization and computational mechanics. Nowadays, my interests lie in data, AI, cloud, and backend technologies.

In my free-time, I enjoy traveling, trying new foods, long-distance running, and hanging out with my cat, Penny.
